# Various-Approaches-for-Improving-GAN-Training
Improving GAN model by 3 different ways

Example of executing ```model.py```

Using Box blur method
```python --blur box model.py```

Using Interpolate blur method
```python --blur interpolate model.py```

Using restrict learning by threshold method
```python --restrict_learning threshold model.py```

Using restrict learning by differential method
```python --restrict_learning differential model.py```
